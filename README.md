DESCRIPTION FOR MULTITHREADED FILE COMPRESSION TOOL

The Multithreaded File Compression Tool is a program designed to speed up the process of compressing large files 
by utilizing multiple CPU cores (threads) in parallel.
By dividing the file into smaller chunks,
The program allows multiple threads to compress these chunks simultaneously,
Reducing the overall time required for compression compared to a single-threaded approach.
